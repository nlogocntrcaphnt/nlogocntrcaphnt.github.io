				What the fuck even is that machine<br>
				Does it have to do with the length of the lever? Except the longer it is the more leverage you have <br>
				Doesn't that defeat the purpose?? Is this the ultimate ego-lifter gymbro machine??<br>
				What a platehogger of a machine <br>
				HOW THE FUCK DO YOU EVEN GET DOWN?? If this is the last set of the last exercise of your leg routine, and you're going to failure, you're telling me you're getting down those 3 steep steps? <br>

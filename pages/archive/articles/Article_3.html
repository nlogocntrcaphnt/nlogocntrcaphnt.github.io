				<br><br>Not all smokers are habitual, nor are all of 'em social, but some habitual smokers are strictly social ones. Overlap in the Venn diagram, 𝐒 ∩ 𝐇. If nicotine as a nootropic or stimulant helps fascilitate conversation, social interaction more generally, then some habitual smokers may very well be conversing with themselves, or with God? Modern shamans? 
				<br><br>"Did you know, each cigarette brings you 11 minutes closer to meeting the Almighty" Even smoking's most dedicated enemies cannot help but admit to the enhancement in contemplation of God, it gets you there faster! 
				<br><br>One would say, nothing more typical than an addict romanticising his vice, but great is the pessimism in this, for to seek to converse with yourself or with God it necessarily implies you need understanding or guidance, for you are lost. This is the metaphysical diagnosis or exegesis of smoking. Physical one being artificially inducing the biological component of the stimulation/excitation you're otherwise missing in your life, amongst other things.

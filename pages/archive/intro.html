			<p>Dimitris Liantinis (/ˌliːənˈtiːnɪs/; Greek: Δημήτρης Λιαντίνης [ʎa(n)ˈdinis]; born 23 July 1942, disappeared 1 June 1998) was a Greek philosopher. He was associate professor at the Department of Pedagogy of the Faculty of Philosophy, Pedagogy and Psychology of the University of Athens, teaching the course "Philosophy of Education and Teaching of Greek Language and Literature" A great lover of Ancient Greek culture, he devoted his life in studying and reinterpreting their cultural heritage. He wrote on various philosophical issues, including education, morality and death."</p>

			<p>Liantinis took his own life on the 1st of June, 1998. The full extent of his intent had only been revealed to his cousin (and best friend), whom he had made swear an oath of secrecy concerning the location of his "voluntary departure", as he'd call it. In a letter addressed to his daughter where he writes:</p>
	
			<p style="font-style: italic; width: 80%; text-align: center; margin: auto;">"..I am leaving by my own volition. Disappearing while still standing<br> on my own two feet, firm and proud."</p>
			<p>The letter was found, sealed in a plastic bag, alongside a lighter, a packet of cigs and a yet unused vile of poison, in the cave where Liantinis carefully chose for his departure from this world.</p>

			<p>Recognition of mountains as foremost mystical places, the natural environment to provide the perfect environmental conditions driving evolutionary pressures moulding the noblest and most rugged(eugenic) of races, and consequently spirits. The one place, alongside perhaps being at sea, where man (and not only him, but even the rock itself) is most exposed to nature, the elements. Nature (God) is its exclusive architect, for thanks to its inaccessibility is most resistant to man's influence, which could only ever serve to degrade it.</p>
		
			<p>Most importantly of all though the brink of the precipice surrounding your feet exerts spiritual pressure. Every single moment spent there presents man with two mutually exclusive choices, a decision. On the one hand is suicide.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="text_insert">
			<p>By virtue of the dichotomy, on the other hand the choice presented to man must be the antithesis of suicide. The diametric opposite of life's negation. Affirmation of life in the most empathic way, the promise of coming to know God (Nature) through deep appreciation and contemplation of the elements battering away at you, seeking to kill you. <b>That which kills never lies.</b></p>

			<p>Integration of the shadow (also known as ego-dystonic complex, repressed id, shadow aspect, or shadow archetype), although a numinous experience is not fully a revelation in the sense that it is never a done deal. One must be in constant process of reconquest, guaranteed only by perpetual exposure to Death, both physically and spiritually, for the shadow is what is summoned from within when one wanes in the face of Death. Figuratively, we do so when tackling matters of VITAL importance, we call them... One's life must therefore be steeped in meaning, for the potential of its loss to be productive, and must be taken seriously. Seriously not in a barren, sterile and humourless way but as if it truly matters.</p>

			<p>A now famous actor recounts having met Liantinis randomly after having ran away from home. Intrigued by the boy's circumstance Liantinis approached him. The boy went on to tell him of how he wanted to become a Theologian, to which Liantinis responded with:</p>

			<p style="width: 80%; text-align: center; margin: auto;">"<i>The mind of men cannot grasp the true essence of God, no matter how hard ibt looks. It is as if we're trying to fit an entire sea into a jar. If you want to find Him, you must be in tune nature and aware of His signs within it. There, that's where you should look for God, in nature and in men's eyes, and at some point He will speak to you.</i>"</p>
